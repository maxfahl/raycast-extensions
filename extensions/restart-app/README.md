# Restart App

A Raycast extension that simply restarts applications. It quits an app, or a list of apps, and then starts them again when they have fully quit.

## Features

- **Multi-App Configurations**: Create configurations that restart multiple apps at once, or just add one app to a configuration
- **Startup Arguments**: Specify custom startup arguments for each app
- **Configuration Management**: Create, edit, and delete restart configurations for your applications
- **Quick Restart**: Restart any configured app with a single click
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Create keyboard shortcuts for frequently restarted apps
- **Smart Exit Detection**: Automatically detect when an app has fully quit before starting it again1

## Usage

1. Add a new app configuration by selecting the "Add Configuration" action (Cmd+N)
2. Select an app from the list of installed applications
3. Use the restart action to quickly restart the configured app
4. Alternatively, create a Raycast Quicklink for keyboard shortcut access, read below

## Quick Link Shortcut Creation

The extension offers a convenient way to create quicklinks bound directly to a configuration:

1. Select a configured app from your list
2. Choose "Create Quicklink URL" from the action menu
3. A quicklink URL will be copied to your clipboard automatically
4. Run the "Create Quicklink" command from Raycast
5. Paste the URL into the "Link" input field
6. Assign your preferred keyboard shortcut to the new quicklink
7. Now you can restart all app (or apps) in the configuration directly with your keyboard shortcut from anywhere
